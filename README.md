# Grating-AFM-Processing
AFM Processing Script Using Python

This code measures line height , wall angle, feature width, and is currently getting sidewall error quanitification added.
Intended for use with periodic, straight, line features only, such as gratings.

This code is intended to be run on the most recent version of python using my fork of pySPM which can be found here: https://github.com/iopredman/pySPM
If you need to run with main branch of pySPM, an older version of python is needed, and the 2D AFM images may be flipped or not work.
